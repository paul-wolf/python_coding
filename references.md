Mypy http://mypy-lang.org/ is the reference implementation for type
hint checking. Remember, type hints have no influence at all
on runtime.

Debuggers

Most Python devs use an IDE like PyCharm or VSCode. Entry
points for debugging are easy to set up. If you use those or
any other tool, you still want to be able to load code into pdb or one
of its variants:

* pdb is the standard debugger for Python. It's part of the PSL. You
want to be familiar with basic workings of this tool. But like the
default Python repl, it is awkward. Use ipdb instead which uses
iPython.

* ipdb https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb lets you access ipython
  features. It is generally a better experience than using pdb
  directly.

* pudb is a curses based debugger and might be more friendly but won't
always work as reliably as ipdb. https://github.com/inducer/pudb

Repls

iPython http://ipython.org/ is the standard repl in practice for Python. 

Notebooks: jupyter https://jupyter.org/ is a web application wrapper
around iPython. Jupyter notebooks have revolutionised Python
development by allowing much easier sharing of programming knowledge,
saving your code experiments in an easier to access form and
especially scientific and numerical applications.
